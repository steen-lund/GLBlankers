This is the second release of the GLBlankers. There has been a lot of bug fixes, mostly in the configuration
UI, and a couple of new blankers have been added to the package.

These screensaver are based one the screen savers found in xscreensaver by Jamie Zawinski and many more.
Find the originals here: http://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/

The following blankers requires MiniGL 2.0:
	GLSchool

The following blankers requires MiniGL 1.5:
	GLBlockTube
	GLBoxed
	GLCubenetic
	GLKnots

The rest works with any version of MiniGL
(GLFlurry will look best with MiniGL 2.0 because of gluBuildMipMap)

Special thanks to René W. Olsen for the module framework.

Installation is simple:
Copy the blankers to Sys:Utilities/Blankers/

Goto https://github.com/steen-lund/GLBlankers to follow the development and get the latest source code.

Disclaimer:
Use these at your own risk, don't blame me for lost data, faulty RAM, dead hard drives, burnt CPU's or
anything else.

--- Known Issues ---
I do not have a Linux setup, so I have not been able to compare the visual appearance of
each blanker to the originals, so they might be different.

Some blankers are slow and eat a lot of CPU time, so don't expect to crunch a lot of RC5 keys while
running these blankers.
